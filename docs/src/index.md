# Damysos

*A package to solve the Semiconductor Bloch equations using GPU or CPU.*

Documentation for [Damysos](https://git.uni-regensburg.de/how09898/Damysos.jl).

# Package features
- Modular building blocks (driving field, Hamiltonian etc. ) for creating simulations
- Using velocity-gauge to parallelize over k-points
- Run any Simulation on GPU or CPU without re-writing any code
- Built using the powerful [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqDocs.jl) and [DiffEqGPU.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl)
